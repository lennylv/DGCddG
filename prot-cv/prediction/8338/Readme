There are two ways can be used to generate 8338 folds from s4169. We run experiments under these two
different ways and record the worse results.
1. Generate folds from s4169 folds.
fold = 0
for train, test in s4169_folds:
 S8338[fold][0]=train + [i+4169 for i in train]
 S8338[fold][0]=test + [i+4169 for i in test]
 fold += 1

2. Generate folds from s4169 protein clusters.
Under different split conditions (for example, the value of folds_number), 1~2 clusters’ size can be bigger than the threshold (s4169/folds_number). With greedy algorithm, the exceed part will be put in the next fold. Obviously, when each cluster’s size is doubled for s8338, the exceed part will be changed.
