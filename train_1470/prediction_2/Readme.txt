The capri_t55.npy and capri_t56.npy were calculated based on the graphs constructed from dimers.
Therefore, the results here are -0.056 and 0.193 for capri_t55 and capri_t56, respectively.

The paper records the result under graphs constructed from multi-chain complex, i.e. -0.0216 and -0.06 for capri_t55 and capri_t56.
We will update them soon.
